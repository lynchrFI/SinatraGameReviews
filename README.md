# GameReviews!
- Hello everyone, and to whom it may concern. This is a game review application! It allows anyone to write reviews on any game you'd like and to keep track of them! This is a sinatra application that allows and user to, create an account, log in to their account, log out, post a review on any video game they choose, edit said review, and delete said review. 

## Getting Started
- You want to make sure you have either downloaded the files or cloned the repo in your terminal. 
- After you have cloned the application you want to get into the right directory, in order to do that ``` cd gamereviews ``` 
- From here just type in bundle install and wait for the gems to be installed! 

## Running the test
- Into your terminal type 'rackup' and your local server will begin running.
- Then all you have to do is type into your browser localhost: then the ip!
